Product Description: The TUF Gaming GeForce RTX� 3090 Ti takes an expertly sculpted design and refines it even further. Its trio of Axial-tech fans are 20% taller and feature a half-width barrier ring designed for increased airflow. Additional fan turbulence optimizations keep noise levels down as the GPU dishes out frames, and a stop mode brings fans to a standstill during light usage. Passive cooling also gets a boost by expanding heatsink size, bringing the card�s total width to 3.2-slots. And alongside, a slew of enhancements championed by its award-winning predecessors ensure the TUF is an absolute powerhouse for builders on the hunt for gaming bliss.
