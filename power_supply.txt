Product Description: Inside and out, our first PSU is packed with innovative ideas. Externally, Aura Sync RGB illumination and an integrated OLED information panel enable unique customization and monitoring options for your ROG gaming rig. Under the hood, high-quality capacitors, a 135mm Wing-blade fan and large heatsinks allow the ROG Thor 850W to achieve LAMBDA A+ and 80 PLUS Platinum certifications, making it ideal for PC enthusiasts who demand performance perfection. ASUS Aura Sync is an illumination ecosystem that lets you synchronize lighting effects across your gaming rig, components and peripherals. The ROG Thor lets you take full control with internal Aura RGB LEDs that connect to the 4-1 addressable RGB header on select motherboards. The ROG Thor 850W Platinum is the first PC PSU in the world to feature an integrated OLED panel, offering a real-time display of power draw. Now you can see at a glance how much juice your rig is using. We've equipped the ROG Thor 850W Platinum with a 135mm patented Wing-blade fan to maximize component lifespan. IP5X dust-resistance keeps it spinning freely and 0dB technology utilizes thermal sensors to allow the fan to switch off completely at lower wattages — enabling totally silent operation. The integrated ROG heatsinks have 2x more volume than traditional designs, resulting in 20 percent lower temperatures inside the ROG Thor 850W Platinum. This extends the lifespan of components and allows 0dB operation for a longer duration than standard designs. The heatsinks are so effective that fan noise never exceeds 20dB, allowing ROG Thor to achieve LAMBDA A+ certification. The ROG Thor 850W Platinum utilizes top-end Japanese capacitors to ensure efficient operation. This has earned an 80 PLUS Platinum certification, which guarantees 89 percent efficiency at 100 percent load and 92 percent at 50 percent load. The increased efficiency produces less heat, reducing fan noise and increasing reliability.
